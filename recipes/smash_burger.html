            <h2>Directions:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Using your hands, combine the ground beef with onion, chiles, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl or container until evenly incorporated. Shape into 8 equal sized balls.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Heat a large cast-iron skillet or griddle over high heat until its smoking. Add 2 tablespoons oil. Add 4 meatballs and immediately flatten them to around 1/4 inch thickness with a wide and sturdy spatula. Cook until the bottoms are crisp and a deep brown, about 1 minute. Flip the patties, top each with 1 slice of cheese, and cook until bottoms are well charred and the cheese is melted, 45 seecondns to 1 minute. Remove from skillet, and cover to keep warm. Repeat with remaining 2 tablespoons oil, remaining 4 meatballs, and remaining 4 cheese slices.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Brush the cut sides of buns with butter. With the pan, skillet, or griddle mentioned previously, toast the cut sides of the buns. Toast until buns are a bit crisp. Spread each bottom bun with 1 1/2 tablespoons mayonnaise, top with 2 patties, and spoon 1 1/2 tablespoons Hatch chile salsa over top. Cover with top bun halves and serve immediately.</p>
